### Edge detection of renaissance/classical paintings for line art embroidery

I first created this project as a means to find the best lines for embroidering classical art.  In embroidery, bold, stark lines are best for portraying the element of classic art.  This project uses a variety of image filtering techniques to correctly identify the best and boldest one.
